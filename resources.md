Here, I store links to resources that I've either personally used or think might come in handy in the future. It's not really specific to one particular day, and I want it to be easy to access. So, I'm making it its own page.

* Free art content
  * https://unsplash.com/
    * for free high-quality photos.
  * https://undraw.co/
    * open source clip art.
* Text editor
  * slate.js
    * still experimenting, seems pretty good for building editors.
* Video chat
  * https://www.around.co/
    * I'm never perfectly happy with vidchat and hopefully this is a step in the right direction.
* Open source content
  * https://opensourcedesign.net/resources/
    * somebody made a better resource compilation than me lol.
* Coding
  * https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
    * seems like a great summary of what I/anyone would need to learn to become a good developer
  * https://www.theodinproject.com/
    * how I got into coding in the first place. We're also trying to replicate this with codex.
