Welcome to my personal blog—this is where I store my personal musings and day to day progress. I'm currently working on a Neo-backed startup with three of my good friends—check it out at [orchard.ink](https://orchard.ink/). Previously, I was an AI grad student at Stanford (currently on leave), and I did my undergrad at Columbia (studied CS). During college, my interests/work experience primarily revolved around math and quant trading, but more recently I've been building in the AI space.
