Welcome to my personal blog—this is where I originally set out to store my personal musings and day to day progress. This blog has seen several phases of my life. In 2022 to 2023, I worked on a Neo-backed startup with three of my good friends—we pivoted around many ideas, with a particularly heavy focus on what gen-AI could enable in the early days of GPT hype. From 2021 to 2022, I was an AI grad student at Stanford (eventually dropped out), and I did my undergrad in 3 years at Columbia (studied CS). During college, my interests/work experience primarily revolved around math and quant trading, but I found myself in the AI/startup space post-graduation. Currently, funnily enough, I am once again in quant trading at Citadel Securities, trading Block single stock options.
