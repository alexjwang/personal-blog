## Accoutability
Today wasn't a perfect day, but it was definitely reasonably productive. This school year has been off to a good start, and while I can still feel the effects of my procrastination tendencies, it is a lot better than last year. I don't feel any withdrawals from league, and I definitely feel as though I have a lot more time on my hands.

Also, today will mark the first time I've fulfilled all of my dailies in a really long time (third time ever overall actually)!

## Productive Thought
Getting to a place where my posts are short and sweet was a goal of mine for a while. Now that I'm here, however, it's hard for me to relinquish my previous perfectionist tendencies reminiscent of my previous blog posts. Particularly, with shorter posts, it's a lot harder to write insightful posts in so few words. I really respect writers who are able to do that.

Along that vein of thought, minimalism is arguably much harder than its alternatives. Often, it's relatively easy to make something impressive or extraodinary if you have a lot to work with. It is much harder to make something just as impressive/extraodinary if you only have one or two things to differentiate such a thing as so.

But when you're successful, it is so much more gratifying. I really want to get good at doing things well with as few components/steps as possible, even if it's harder/takes more time. Eventually a minimalistic approach will be so much faster and easier on my life--however, like all things worthwhile, it'll take time and practice to achieve.
