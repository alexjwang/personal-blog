## reasoning
We met a dude named Aman Sanger at the Neo Reunion, who is working on a startup in the same space that we have been exploring for the past week. He wrote a [postmortem](https://amansanger.com/posts/enstil.html) on one of his past projects, and I thought his day by day timeline would be cool to emulate. I've been meaning to do this for my personal life (as I've previously blogged about), but having a more professional reason behind it might be the activation energy I've been lacking to finally implement the habit.

I think the easiest/most sustainable form of this habit would be to simply write a sentence or two on what we did, track a KPI, and maybe upload a photo/video. The format of these logs will most likely change over time as I figure out what's optimal. This'll help me avoid having to write massive, multi-week documents on what we've done/where we're heading—plus I believe it'll be super fun/nostalgic to look back at these logs in the future.

## logs

Village Technologies was incorporated on 4/18. I'll consider that Day 1, but the actual Day 1 is up in the air. It could be the first day we started working on Village full-time (July 1). It could be when the four of us won HackMIT with our project, "Villager," or even earlier when we attended our first hackathon as a team at PennApps (Creddit). It could be the first day I met Kevin and John, our first YC application for S21, or even the early days of when I used to go over to Tae's house and work on college apps together. But anyways, the day Village was legally formed sounds a nice origin date.

### Day 170: October 5, 2022

We had a regroup session in the morning today and concluded that it's time to start building. We've been doing a lot of research into what the capabilities of AI are today—we have a better idea now of what people have already done, but the conclusion is that nobody really knows what the near future of AI looks like. We can read, write, and explore AI stuff even more, but there are rapidly diminishing marginal returns here. It's now time to build and see what insights/skills we can derive from the process.

The general feeling is that AI is fascinating from a technical perspective (we're all nerds), and we are excited by the wave of applications that this technology unlocks. For now, we are more than happy to continue working in this space.

We have a couple of questions that we have no answers to at the moment. The first is even though the AI industry is rapidly growing, whether or not a billion dollar company will come out of the AI space in the future. If no company exists, there's nowhere we can position ourselves to capture said company. Another is what exact project we want to build out—for now, we've settled on copilot for Figma. However, I personally believe we should optimize for both technical learnings as well as extensibility/implications of if we do manage to successfully build out an application.

### Day 171: October 6, 2022

We were relatively parallelized today on what we were looking at. Kevin has been digging a lot into serverless GPUs—there seems to be a lot of promise there. John did a lot of reading on RLHF frameworks, specifically focusing on math/terminology. Tae focused on UX + product—the main problem at hand is that a lot of what we can imagine hinges on our model being nearly flawless. I'm also doing a lot of reading, but I've also been focusing on writing memos as a method of extracting insights that'll hopefully push our product towards success. We have also begun to set up calls with UX designers—we figure that it'll be supremely useful to witness Figma experts at work.

### Day 172: October 7, 2022

We had a longer meeting this morning about what we want to get done. Discussing together what our product will look like, bigger picture/endgame stuff, as well as technical limitations was really useful—I can feel that we're getting better at team discussions, which is great. I set up a lot of calls with UX designers—hopefully they'll provide us valuable data for future use.
