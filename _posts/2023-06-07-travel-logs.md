As some of you may know, I left my startup a few weeks ago. I'll be moving back to NYC in a few months, and in the meantime, I figured it'd be the best use of my time to write logs for each day, similar to what I did for startups. This'll give me some excuse to try to log everything I do on my mega trip and hopefully force me to take more high quality pictures—a secondary benefit of this is helping improve my recall, which I've been more conscious of working on.

## Day 1: Thursday, June 1, 2023
I spent the majority of this day flying from SFO to Hawaii. The morning was quite tiring as I saved all my packing for that specific morning. This was mostly because I had such a busy week prior to this—I had made my best effort to hang out with all my California friends before I left on my big Asia trip, but this resulted in essentially 4 days straight of heavy drinking which was honestly quite brutal. I honestly don't remember the last time I've drank that many days in a row (normally even two in a row is a stretch).

## Day 2: Friday, June 2, 2023
First full day in Hawaii was pretty chill—I just stayed home and fished all day. I brought my fly rod because the last time I was here, I saw the tilapia feeding a lot on the surface. However, it turns out that they're not quite as keen on biting top water flies as I thought they would be. I also tried fishing some nymphs but it didn't really work out as anticipated. My first impressions upon returning is that there's a ton of tilapia fry that's quite tough to get through—last time I was here, the tilapia were much bigger so it was easier for them to eat the bait. Now, there are huge schools of baby fish that just swarm/peck the bait, making it impossible for the larger tilapia to get to my bait. 

For lunch, I bought a pound of salt and vinegar chicken wings for $5 at Safeway, which was kind of a ridiculous deal. It's predicated on you getting a (free) Safeway membership however, so my hypothesis here is that it has to be some sort of loss leader in order to get people on the membership (and thus increase loyalty).

## Day 3: Saturday, June 3, 2023
Honestly, I don't really remember too much about what I did this day. Sophia and her mom went to check out a new ceramics place that they just got membership for—while I waited for them, I walked their dog, Pudge, in Chinatown. I was warned that Hotel St was kinda sus, but when I ended up there on accident, it was fine. Honestly, it felt similar to the average street in SF.

I went to a nice cafe with Sophia and got some poke for dinner before she dropped me off at home. I spent most of the rest of the day chilling with the dog and fishing—I've been having a super relaxing week.

## Day 4: Sunday, June 4, 2023
Sophia really wanted me to do ceramics with her and her mom, so that's what we did in the morning. Afterwards, I helped move furniture out of her grandma's apartment—it was rather physical labor, but I'm really glad I was able to help out. It's the least I can do for how they've allowed me to crash at their apartment all week.

## Day 5: June 5, 2023
Honestly, I thought I would be a lot more productive this week, but I've just been fishing all day and looking after their dog. It's a nice life though—I love fishing, but I think I would eventually get bored if this was my entire life.

## Day 6: June 6, 2023
I went to Muay Thai with Sophia today—this was pretty much my first time doing martial arts since I was in elementary school. It was definitely an excellent workout and it was moderately fun (definitely more enjoyable than running). However, I didn't have so much fun that I would be positive that I could sustain the sport for a long time when I'm back in NYC. It did make me start thinking about what sort of cardio activity I could do in Manhattan that I would legitimately enjoy/sustain for a long time—the only thing that comes to find is like super amateur/beginner friendly ultimate frisbee with friends, although I don't know how possible that sort of thing is.

## Day 7: June 7, 2023
Today was the first semi-productive day I had in a while, which is kinda surprising that it's taken me this long (but in retrospect it makes sense). I went to a cafe in the morning and called some friends, did some due diligence on some work-related things, and generally practice some more math. However, in the afternoon, I played some TFT as a form of a break, but I got rather addicted/started to tilt queue which was a bad idea.

## Day 8: June 8, 2023
Sophia spent the day with her grandma, so it was just me and her parents today. The nice thing about this was that I was able to have a Japanese lesson with her mom. The phonology of Japanese is actually much easier than I expected (easier than Chinese), although I feel that I’m still quite far from being able to follow along with conversational Japanese.

After that, I was supposed to spend some time learning the alphabet for Japanese, but truth be told, I spent way too much time playing TFT (tilt queueing into the afternoon). I took a brief fishing break before I walked Pudge, which was a fun activity (I caught probably the biggest tilapia this trip yet on this session).

Note from 12/23/23: I never ended up journaling the rest of my Asia trip. I kinda regret it, but at the same time, keeping up with writing every day while also being super tired from travelling was near impossible.
