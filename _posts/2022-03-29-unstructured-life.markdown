## spring quarter

I didn't blog at all during winter quarter, which is interesting because I definitely had the most free time in pretty much my entire life. The start of the quarter was particularly roughâ€”I had very little to do, and, although I didn't realize it at the time, that apparently has a very strong effect on my mental. I can also feel my writing/communication skills deteriorate by the day as I write less and less, so it is nice to sit down once in a while and just write out my thoughts, if not for nothing than just the act of writing.

With the lesson of winter quarter behind me and spring quarter having started yesterday, I figured it's a good time to sit and plan out what could potentially be my final quarter at Stanford.
