## logs
We are heading deeper into product development this week.

### Day 182: October 17, 2022
John has gotten Figma code generation from json working for mostly everything. What's left is data labelling for training our model, and figuring out how to actually make the model good. I'm digging deeper into an AI writing tool. Kevin has finished his initial exploration into hosted GPUs and is continuing to read more academic/developer literature on generative AI.

### Day 183: October 18, 2022
We're continuing to play around with component generation to slowly improve it. Currently, setting properties such as colors is difficult, but creating the components themselves from prompts is possible. The prompts themselves are more component descriptions rather than what humans would actually write, but getting the model working is more important than UI/UX atm, which will come later.

### Day 184: Octoboer 19, 2022
We're still working on developing conviction on AI for design. To that end, we are returning back to hypothesis validation. However, we are still spending the bulk of our time on technical exploration.

We have a research channel where we send each other links. I'm going to attach one interesting link every day if people are interested in reading what we read.

This is an interesting [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Buntworthy/status/1582307817884889088?s=20&t=-l9Lkw3PQtO73tw2oZ9k2g) that showcases how good people are getting at fine-tuning LLMs.
