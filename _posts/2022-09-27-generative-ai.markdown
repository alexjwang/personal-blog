## pivoting
After deciding to move on from our scripts to internal apps idea, we were deeply considering presenting on spreadsheets at demo day. After a minor team crisis on how to throw together a presentation for demo day, we ultimately decided to pull out of presenting. Around the same time, we became more enamored with the Twitter/VC buzz around generative AI and, as a team, decided that it was worth a deep dive exploration.


## recent hype
Right now is an extremely exciting time for generative AI. With the release of GPT-3 last year, the public's eyes were opened to the possibility of AI surpassing human ability for types of artistic work. And, with the recent release of DALL-E 2 and the even more recent release of Whisper by Open AI, the possibility has turned into reality. The craziest things is that the models that these AI's are built on, the transformer, is relatively simple/unimaginative. We just simply threw more data at these models, and the results have been stupidly goodâ€”with how fast the field is moving, it almost seems like an inevitablity that AI will far surpass anyone's expectations as more thought/development is sunk into this space.

I've been reading a lot of content in this space over the past couple days, and I don't think it's time-efficient to run through each piece. Instead, here are some of my thoughts on just a few that I've picked.
