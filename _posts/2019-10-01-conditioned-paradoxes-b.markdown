## Accountability
Even though I didn't have YouTube videos to watch, since I wasn't particularly busy, I had some trouble forcing myself to work during large chunks of free time. Will need to continue working on it, but something that seems to be working is to force myself to check habitica to see if there's anything I could do.

## Productive Thought
I've been noticing a trend among quant interviews where they try to trick you by purposefully feeding you easier questions to alter your thinking. Then, when you think a certain way, they make a small change to the problems that you're solving, often completing altering the problem. Since the change is so small, it's hard to convince yourself that the solution/answer will change in a significant way, so you often get stuck in the same, erroneous line of thinking.

This extends to the way people think in general--learning tends to be simply extrapolating from past experiences. I find it fascinating that MORE experience can actually lead one to be more likely to make incorrect decisions.
