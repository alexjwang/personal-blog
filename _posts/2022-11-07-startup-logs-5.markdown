## logs
We are working on building out and launching a beta for our AI writing project this week.

### Day 203: November 7, 2022
All four of us are focused on building out the product now. I'm still stuck on building out edit suggestionsâ€”working with the editor DOM has actually been super annoying to figure out from scratch (I keep running into a lot of bugs regarding our sync engine as well).

*Is it just me or is cutting scallions super satisfying*

### Day 204: November 8, 2022
We've built out essentially all the basic functionalities you'd want in a non-AI-powered text editor. There's only one AI feature that's really left (the edit suggestions that I'm working on). There's a lot of gnarly CRDT sync stuff with rich text that I'm still sorting through, but progress today along this front has been pretty good.
