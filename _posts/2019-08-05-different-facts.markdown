## Accountability
I struggled with staying focused through the beginning of work. While I was not directly wasting time, it was difficult to apply myself completely to my work. Towards the end of the day, I got into a groove and ended up staying over an hour later than usual working on a problem. I have a weird tendency of being unable to put down unsolved problems, which goes back to my olympiad days (I think many can attest to this). This sounds good in principle, but it can prove harmful--last year, I often didn't start assignments unless I knew I could finish it in that one sitting.

Working late threw off my schedule as I ended up not going to the gym. I also technically broke my habit of work before leisure, but this leisure was structured, so I won't count it against my habit. I stayed below my 2 hour threshold for wasted time, and the leisure activity I did have was not wasted (I had a lot of fun and socialized).

Overall, I can feel the initial wave of motivation from starting this blog starting to fade, and it'll be interesting if I can continue to stick to my habits.

## Productive Thinking
I'm going to preface this section by saying that this is something that's really hard for me to write about to the public. It is something that's politically very touchy, and I'm ashamed of some of the views I used to hold. Yet, this is a topic that continually deeply affects my life and is nearly always on my mind, so this will be the first (of many times, hopefully) I'll touch upon the ideas surrouding affirmative action.

While I was thinking about whether or not to write this piece, I struggled with how to frame my ideas. I'm aware of how personal this topic is for me, and in my writing/analysis, I've always tried really hard to be objective and logical. Yet, when I was brainstorming, I realized that all my perspectives were inherently biased--my ideas are influenced by my experiences, and it's nearly impossible to incorporate perspectives into my ideas that I've never experienced.

Even more unsure about the wisdom of pursuing such a topic, I consulted my closest friend who advised me that perhaps sometimes the best that we can hope for is to put our own perspective out there for others to consider and consider the other perspectives that others have shared for us. 

As an Asian male from a competitive high school in the Bay Area, I check almost every stereotype that affirmative action policies throw at me. As a result, I've gone through several stages of emotion: initial confusion at the existence of such policies, crippling sadness at the failure of goals due to factors outside of my control, slowly boiling resentment due to feelings of entitlement to opportunities/praise denied to me, and, more recently, quiet shame/fear of being judged for my position of privilege and lack of perspective.

I'll claim that affirmative action is a topic that's so personal to so many individuals that it's impossible to pick an "absolute truth." Everybody has their own set of personal evidence, and, for this kind of multi-faceted, opinionated topic, different evidence will lead to different, even contradicting, facts. Being on the short end of the stick of morality, I constantly worry about being persecuted and shamed for my perspective--and I have, sometimes justly, and sometimes not. But what I'm beginning to realize, just as how I cannot fully understand others' experiences, others may not know of my own. So in forcing myself to start opening up about my perspective, I'm hoping not only to get over my fear/shame of my place in the affirmative action debate, but also add another perspective that I've so desperately longed to hear somebody else share.
