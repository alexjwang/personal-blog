We're wrapping up software development for our latest iteration of Orchard this week.

## Day 287: Monday, January 30, 2023

The primary update is that John and I are doing a 48 hour fast. The backstory/motivation is pretty stupid: we were having Applebees AYCE, when John made a comment about how he wasn't going to eat for a week. I said I was down, but upon reconsideration, decided that I wasn't going to make it an entire week. So we shortened it to 2 days, and day 1 has been truly awful.

In startup related news, I'm continuing to work on growth related issues—the editor is slowly coming together, and soon we'll merge our staging branch.

## Day 288: Tuesday, January 31, 2023

The fast ends today—honestly I have no clue how I managed to make this this far. It's been simultaneously harder and easier than I expected. The feeling of hunger is way more intense/painful that I thought it would be. On the flip side however, it was easier than I thought to push through that level of pain. Even if there are no health benefits, it was nice to prove to myself that I'm capable of doing something physically very difficult—I guess it was worth it in that sense?

As for work related things, I've decided to put growth/miscellaneous tasks on the side burner and start helping out on building out our core features—a lot of them are blocking for our team, so it'll be useful to finish those up and then afterwards look to see what tasks are the next highest priority.

## Day 289: Wednesday, February 1, 2023

Nothing super notable. Just software development + design work today.

## Day 290: Thursday, February 2, 2023

Writing these logs are actually such a painful part of my morning routine, but I feel like at this point there's some element of sunk cost.

We're did a database migration in the late evening—we had a couple minor hiccups, as expected, but the end result was really good. Previously, our database servers and EC2 instance were on opposite coasts of the US—we moved them close together, and now the latency on our app is 10x faster.

## Day 291: Friday, Feburary 3, 2023

Today was yet another day of churning through software development tickets. For me, I also had to take a number of calls, but they were more so for others rather than for Orchard—it's strange to me how tiring talking is. I feel like I can code for hours sometimes, but taking a single 45 minute call leaves me feeling rather drained.

Weekend update: we are witnessing a ton of buzz on Twitter regarding product updates, which is making us feel rather antsy. Hopefully, we can launch very soon.
