This week, we're focusing heavily on user feedback as well as starting development on the next version of Orchard.

## Day 274: Monday, January 16, 2023

We've been getting a lot of inbound regarding job applications which is pretty interesting given that we haven't done anything related to hiring. For now, we're pretty focused on building our next version of Orchard—onboarding new hires would take a bandwidth during a time when we just want to be pushing out code as quickly as possible.

Today, I did another look at our growth numbers—it was a little concerning at first until I realized that people probably don't use our product over the week. I anticipate our DAU to bounce back during the weekdays. I also set up user feedback calls in our Discord—talked to our first user today, which provided some valuable feedback but nothing extremely novel.

## Day 275: Tuesday, January 17, 2023

Today was just a lot of dev work. We've finalized our initial designs for the next iteration of Orchard, and now we're just figuring out how best to divvy up the coding tickets. I'm also working on fixing a number of random bugs that appear minor, but actually require an absurd amount of code to fix.

## Day 276: Wednesday, January 18, 2023

Nothing specific to update here—just a product development kind of day. I'm still working on a number of features that users have requested, but we're transitioning to building out the next version of Orchard.

## Day 277: Thursday, January 19, 2023

Today was a slower day for Orchard. I'm still conducting user feedback interviews—there's always one or two surprising findings from these interviews, which is quite nice. We also began to build out the features related to synthesis of links and information into content generation—AI content generation often runs into this problem of not including relevant/personalized information. This is our attempt at solving it beyond good prompt engineering. 

I've been spending several hours a day studying our users' behaviors/thinking about how to best utilize our received feedback—one interesting overlap here is that a lot of students have been utilizing Orchard as a second brain (input lecture notes into the doc and ask questions on it). They claim that it's better thant searching Google for answers as it's more akin to asking questions live during lecture (but obviously outside of lecture, you no longer have access to your professor). The features that we're currently spending the vast majority of our engineering efforts on should target this specifically. Another interesting overlap is the fact that many of our users (both students + enterprise) have been pasting links into the chat box and asking questions on it. This is a feature that we can hopefully push out within the next week or so. It's nice to have motivation in the form of user feedback.

On a side note, I've been quite enjoying the type of work that growth engineering for a consumer product entails. The types of problems are definitely nontechnical in nature, and learning how solve problems unlike anything I've studied in school has been super intellectually stimulating.

## Day 278: Friday, January 20, 2023

The focus today is still on product development—the biggest feature that should be ready to launch after the weekend is folders. The reason why folders have been a little slower to ship is that whatever design we pick for folder organization will heavilly impact our information synthesis feature set later down the line.

In parallel to product development, I've also been trying to think about growth/go-to-market stuff so that we're ready to go once we're finished with building out all our features. However, this has proven pretty tricky because there aren't really definitively correct answers, and it's hard to verify things without running experiments (impossible while we're still building product).
