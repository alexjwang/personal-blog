## infinite action spaces
At the moment, every morning, I wake up, sit at my desk, and think about what I will work on for the rest of the day. This is actually pretty hard—this is because there is such a large action space. This is in contrast to what I've historically been accustomed to in school/engineering jobs—there, you have defined tasks to do, and all you have to do is figure out the sequence of actions to take to accomplish said tasks. For ideating in startups, nobody is telling you what to do, and you can literally do anything that you can think of (ok, within the realm of sane human being, legal stuff). The thing that makes this tricky is that after you pick something to do, you are lowkey locked into working on that for a while, during which you realistically are not going to be thinking extensively about what the best use of your time is. But the longer you spend just deliberating what to work on, the longer you are spending on...not working. 

Figuring out how to balance this is super hard, and I feel like I'm doing a bad job at it. When I do pick a task to do, it feels like a suboptimal use of my time. When I sit around thinking about what to do, I am painfully aware that I'm not getting anything done either. 

## landscape
Wih the release of GPT-3 and the public's realization of its shockingly good results, the first-order application that immediately comes to everyone's mind is an AI-powered writing tool/text editor. It's quite possibly the lowest-hanging fruit imaginable when it comes to generative AI, and there are several startups that do precisely that (with quite large valuations to boot). However, I've never personally used any of the tools, nor do I know anyone who uses them either. A brief tour of AI Twitter reveals countless demos of AI writing tools—why aren't any of them adopted by the mainstream public, like how Github Copilot has proliferated the dev community?

A lot of the best AI writing tools, like Jasper and CopyAI, are built specifically for copywriting. This includes situations like generating an Amazon product description for your item, writing a blog post about a certain topic, optimize SEO for your content, etc. The product's entire identity is centered around AI, but there's zero AI tech built in house—most of these products are simply a wrapper around GPT-3 with a UI/UX tailored for specific copywrite functionalities. These products are entirely input-output driven: you type in a prompt, and the LLM-wrapped product spits out words for you to copy-paste and use. As AI models improve, anyone can easily imagine this replacing humans in copywriting positions. Even today, many people make a living off of being an expert user of Jasper/CopyAI and simply taking contractual, copywriting work. Yet, these products are often advertised as more creative inspiration, something to help with writer's block, rather than a fully automated copywriter replacement. The models simply aren't good enough, the UX is separate from people's text editor and is thus clunky, and, apart from the copywriting use case, essentially nobody utilizes these tools.

This goes back to my long-running thread that, while AI is still developing/improving, it makes more sense to focus on augmenting skilled individuals rather than entirely replacing low-value workers. There is a lot of context stored in a human's brain that cannot be captured by a prompt/preceding sentence, and models currently are simply not good enough to predict brand new content without said context. Furthermore, while AI models can imitate good writing, people have distinct preferences when it comes to writing styles—writing is often an art that's unique to the individual, and having wholly generated content fails in most personal situations.

## ai writing
For most people who write not for a job, writing is often a form of thinking. this means that an AI autocomplete model is not only difficult to execute well, but also destructive in the sense that the writer doesn't get to think through the ideas to generate said sentence. A suggestion model here makes a lot more sense as the writer can focus on the idea generation itself, rather than painstakingly editing their writing style to make their ideas intelligible to the reader.
