## infinite action spaces
At the moment, every morning, I wake up, sit at my desk, and think about what I will work on for the rest of the day. This is actually pretty hard—this is because there is such a large action space. This is in contrast to what I've historically been accustomed to in school/engineering jobs—there, you have defined tasks to do, and all you have to do is figure out the sequence of actions to take to accomplish said tasks. For ideating in startups, nobody is telling you what to do, and you can literally do anything that you can think of (ok, within the realm of sane human being, legal stuff). The thing that makes this tricky is that after you pick something to do, you are lowkey locked into working on that for a while, during which you realistically are not going to be thinking extensively about what the best use of your time is. But the longer you spend just deliberating what to work on, the longer you are spending on...not working. 

Figuring out how to balance this is super hard, and I feel like I'm doing a bad job at it. When I do pick a task to do, it feels like a suboptimal use of my time. When I just sit around thinking about what to do, I am painfully aware that I'm not getting anything done either.
