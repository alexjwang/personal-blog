## logs
We are continuing to build out our AI product. We have the infrastructure for our model finished, but we need to improve the model's performance. We are also going to work on projects on the side/weekends to improve our presence in the AI community.

### Day 196: October 31, 2022
Today was a a big day in terms of deadline but surprisingly passed by quickly. I had a user interview call earlier in the morning with the CEO of an interior design startup about UI/UX design at startups. Then, I spent a couple hours with John going over his fine-tuning pipeline code-there's still a lot of room for improvement in terms of our model performance, so I'm going to try to parallelize some tasks with him to help out.

I think I'm also going to focus exclusively on how to build up our reputation in the AI space/Twitter. In this sort of space, racing for distribution seems to be rather exigentâ€”it also happens to be our biggest weakness, and my goal over the next month is to turn this weakness into a strength. To that end, we'll try to ship out a text editor quickly.
