## Accountability
I did a decent amount of work today, but without time pressure, I really didn't start as much of my homework as I should've. With the extra time today, I did manage to finally touch upon some work that I've been neglecting.

Also, I need to start journaling my habits more, per the challenge that I started. I think I still abuse Youtube a lot more than I should--when I have nothing much to really do, I just default to consuming content on youtube, which isn't good. I need to figure out a way to get the desired break while not resorting to Youtube, which I feel like ends up being a) not that fun and b) a much larger time suck than normal.

Also, I took a really big nap today even though I got a lot of sleep, which is strange. Hopefully this doesn't continue into the school week, because I really need to be able to stay awake during classes.

## Productive Thought
People often do things that many people would agree are completely logical. Yet, there had to be some sort of thought process/rationale behind such an action. I'd argue that everyone is rational/logical in their own mind at each specific moment--one man's logic is another's ridiculous fallacy.
