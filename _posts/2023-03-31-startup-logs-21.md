We've finished our soft launch, and now we're working on doing more first-principles thinking and focusing on customers.

## Day 343: Monday, March 27, 2023

Today, Kevin and I are focusing on squashing the majority of the remaining bugs. Tae and John are writing memos, coming from a first-principles way of thinking. Starting tomorrow, all of us will be doing the same writing/thinkingâ€”a bit of a reset in the type of daily work.

## Day 344: Tuesday, March 28, 2023

We're now all pursuing different threads. I'm focusing on Orchard and exploring what possible future directions we can take it. There are a couple of unresolved threads that I want to fully flesh out before considering pivoting to a different idea. The rest of my team is exploring the world of LLMs + customer data. 

## Day 345: Wednesday, March 29, 2023

The reality is that Orchard as it currently exists is a consumer app. Instead of trying to force an enterprise use case for it, I'm going to approach Orchard in the same way you would grow a typical consumer app. This essentially requires collecting user feedback to improve the product as much as possible until one hits PMF.

## Day 346: Thursday, March 30, 2023

I conducted the first of many user interviews today. To help narrow focus, I'm going to run some experiments with trying to grow our product among student users. This will serve to validate several hypotheses about the usefulness of our product, plus it's a thread that we've been talking about for quite a while but never got around to executing.

## Day 347: Friday, March 31, 2023

The main interesting thing today was a user interview of a student user. They came extremely well-prepared with not only a document of all their feedback, but also a prepared Figma of some design suggestions. It was really uplifting to see a user who was so clearly passionate about Orchard.
