Here, I store links to resources relating to productivity that I've tried and my thoughts on them. In the future, if people are interested, I may add a section on my overall thoughts on productivity/my personal productivity system.

* Matt D'Avella inspired stuff
  * 2-Day Rule
    * My latest experiment in terms of productivity, and I like it so far. There are some mixed results, but that's mostly due to me choosing really hard habits to maintain.
    * For people new to productivity, I *highly* recommend trying out the 2-day rule. It's been working out really well for me and also for everyone I've recommended it to.
    * Watch [Matt D'Avella's video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc).
* Habit Trackers
  * Productive
    * I never bought the premium subscription because I prefer one-time purchases. My overall impression wasn't the greatest––I prefer something more minimal to track my habits, and this wasn't really cutting it.
  * Done
    * Also a habit tracker, I used this one a lot during the summer of 2019. I added too many habits, and I lost motivatio after a couple of months. I tried to return to it, but I stopped using it for the second time after a while.
  * Habitica
    * Used this as a response to Done getting stale for me. Tried to gamify it along with playing with friends. But once friends stopped using it, I stopped using it too.
* Pomodoro's––notoriously hard to maintain long term.
  * Strict Workflow
    * A better Pomodoro timer that restricts your computer usage.
  * Flora
    * Good way to collaboratively work with others. Also indirectly heavily restricts your phone usage. I found myself reaching for my phone a ton for literally no reason––Flora helps you catch yourself though.
  * Toggl
    * Not really a Pomodoro, but also a good way to track time. Used this during Fall 2019 finals. It was alright, but I haven't really used it since. I feel like Pomodoro's/Flora might do a better job since it both sets a pace as well as restricts your distractions.
  * BeFocused
    * Wanted something with a little more customizability than a standard Pomodoro. Hasn't worked out super great.
* Distraction Removers
  * StayFocused
    * Used this a lot in high school. Pretty good, except you can get around it using incognito.
  * Freedom
    * Blocks distracting websites on your device. It's been working well, but keep aware of the fact that you might find other ways to procrastinate, even with the usual suspects blocked.
  * Motion
    * Similar to Freedom, but is free and doesn't hard block websites. Instead allows you to set allotted timers on it. A YC combinator startup, so I'm a little biased.
    * They're really good at making their product an enjoyable experience for the user, and they push out a ton of new content all the time.
* Gantt Schedulers
  * Trying ClickUp. Quit immediately. Too much functionality for me, not enough dedication to try it.
