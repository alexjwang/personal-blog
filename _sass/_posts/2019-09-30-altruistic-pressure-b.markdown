## Accountability
Funny thing was that, in my procrastinating, I did a lot of homework assignments. Bad thing was that I was doing it through procrastinating. Still got work to do.

## Productive Thought
Talked about this at length with Ursula today, so I'll elaborate upon it more in the future. Essentially, social pressures to continue pursuing an activity that you would've otherwise quit is overall good for society, but can harm certain individuals (while greatly benefitting others). This is very similar to altruism/game theory ideas.
