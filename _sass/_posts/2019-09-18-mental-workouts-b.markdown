## Accountability
It is late, so I shall try to keep it short. I will need to wake up earlier tomorrow to do my modern analysis pset.

I am going to try a new habitica challenge regarding kicking my habit of watching YouTube or doing random things to procrastinate instead of working. To pinpoint exactly why I procrastinate in the way I do, I'm going to try reading/doing leetcode/doing a habitica checkpoint instead of watching YouTube. Every time I do this, it should leave me more time at the end of the night to watch Youtube, of which I'll limit myself to one video per time I resisted the urge.

I also tend to randomly check my phone during lectures to just see what's up. Instead of going on instagram/the internet, I'll go on habitica and see if there's anything worth doing/I'll plan out my schedule for after that lecture.

## Productive Thought
There's a lot of terms surrounding mental fatigue, and in my quest to be more productive, I'm aware of physical limitations of working for too long. When I'm tired, I often can't do really complicated problems or code complicated projects--there's definitely a way to strengthen this, but I find it interesting that so many people acknowledge there's such a thing as mental strength, but pay a lot less attention to working out one's brain relative to their body. It is almost certainly due to the fact that physical workouts are a lot more tangible, and humans place a greater importance on things they can more directly interact with.
