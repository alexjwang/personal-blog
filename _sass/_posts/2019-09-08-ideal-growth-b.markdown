## Accountability
I was at PennApps this past weekend--interestingly enough, was one of the few hackathons where I didn't completely destroy my brain through a lack of sleep. I was particularly proud of the ML problem that I solved this hackathon, and although our project didn't shine in terms of winning prizes, I'm pretty satisfied with my personal knowledge of how difficult our project was (I swear I'm not just being cocky--I actually really liked the project).

This'll be my first test at my new system of accountability/shorter productive thinking.

## Productive Thought
After reconvening with people from both high school and college, I noticed that some people change immensely while others change slowly. In general, I feel as though I have changed a lot even though my ideas in these day-to-day blog posts do not seem to shift much.

My initial thoughts are:

1) People change and experience growth at vastly varying rates.

2) These rates are not only variable, but they can be controlled.

3) It is more than fine to not experience constant, revolutionary growth, but it can't hurt to inflect about how you personally grow from day to day.
