## Accountability
I tried scheduling today--it helped in the sense that I wasted less time on Youtube (large chunks of unstructured time felt more structured, for lack of a better explanation). However, even with conservative estimates for how long things would take, I wildly underestimated how long things would take. I forgot why I don't do schedules...

## Productive Thought
Someone told me about an analogy that nerds who don't value fashion look like how raw html websites appear to people who are skilled in UI/UX. I thought this was interesting, especially given that fact that many "nerds" don't know or value fashion while the vast majority of people in society do. Similarly, people who don't know UI/UX and only know HTML would not be able to realize how they look to people highly skilled in UI/UX. Most people nowadays are used to good UI/UX.
