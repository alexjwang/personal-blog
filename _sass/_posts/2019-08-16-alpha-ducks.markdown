## Accountability
Work today wasn't the most productive, but it is nearing the end of the internship and I finished a major project yesterday. Had a lot of fun today at work, and didn't waste much time once I got back home! Overall happy with productivity today.

## Productive Thinking

#### I had a staring match with a duck today
I had a staring match with a duck todayâ€”

A perfectly beautiful day, one that

Makes you forget imperfections: A mellow sun 

that warms the coldness

Of storms and soothes the burns

Of solar flares, A tangy sax quartet

That charms the dissonance 

Of unsavory converse and excites the soundtrack

Of daily life. A youthful green field

That colorizes the monotony

Of concrete structures and kickstarts the pause

Of frozen progress. A slight rippling surface

That calms the crashing waves

Of life drama and moves the flatness

Of steady routine. But most particularly, a duck 

that I had a staring match with.


He looked me up and down, confused

I looked him back, challenged

He puffed out his chest, unabashed

I studied his feathers, flapping

He approached wing-first, taken aback

I broke the eye contact, content,

He waddled back into the water, laughing, 

I walked out of the park, happy all because


I lost a staring match with a duck today.
