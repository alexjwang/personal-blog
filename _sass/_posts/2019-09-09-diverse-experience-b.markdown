## Accountability
Today was a mix of in terms of productivity. It started out really well--I attended lecture, met with my research person, and then worked for a long time in the library (defeating my procrastination tendencies).

But then I fell asleep (again) for 2 hours and ended up talking to friends for the rest of the night. I could've done all my dailies but I kinda failed in that regard.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with beating my procrastination habit for the first time in school. It's a lot better to do work earlier in the day and procrastinate later at night rather than the reverse. In times where I'm actually pressed for time, this is a good foundation to lay for the future.

## Productive Thought
I touched upon this in previous posts, but I'm going to dedicate this short entry to it because I really believe in its importance.

I always think about a concept I dub "diversity of experience." Essentially, it means that people value things more if they introduce new, diverse experiences--this drives individual growth because it makes people excited and therefore more inclined to learn new things. 

I first formally thought about this in my AP Econ course in high school, where the concept of "the law of dimininishing marginal returns." Doing the same thing repeatedly brings an individual diminishing happiness with each repetition. I also touched upon this in one of my earliest posts--people like nature because it's such a nice break from the machinations of daily life.

Personally, I see this concept applied everywhere in my life as it makes me passionate about learning and trying out new things. This is definitely something that I'm going to continue bringing up in my future posts because it's so integral to my life philosophy.
